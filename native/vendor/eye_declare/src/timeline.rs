//! The synchronous runtime core: a timeline of committed blocks plus a
//! live tail, speaking [`Element`]s on one side and escape bytes on the
//! other.
//!
//! This is both the imperative escape hatch (sync loops, embedding) and
//! the layer the Elm runtime drives: `ctx.push` lands on [`Timeline::push`],
//! each frame ends in [`Timeline::present`].
